# Bar-visualizer-card
A custom Lovelace card for Home Assistant that displays an animated audio-style bar visualizer driven by an entity state (typically a media_player).  The card uses absolute pixel heights (no scale hacks), supports per-profile configuration (playing, calm, freeze, etc.), and allows detailed visual customization via YAML.
